# Classification---Data-Mining

* This is an example of using (simple) a classification tree model and boosting for a prediction task. 
* I try to predict the gender of students !!! 
* Quite difficult task -> accuracy quite low.
* The dataset is available online (check the references). If having trouble finding it contact me.
* You need the "datamining.bib" in your working directory to compile the Rmd file. 
* the "datamining.bib" stores the references. If not familiar with Bibtex, just delete the "bibliography: datamining.bib" from the Rmd preamble (12th line) - it compiles without the citations and refs.
* you can always check the references from the pdf file.
* the Rmd takes about 2 min to compile for me (2,4 GHz Intel Core i5).
